# Penguin Watch Mobile

Here's what Zooniverse's [Penguin Watch](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch/) might look like on mobile.

## Main difference from the web app

1. The `Done` process felt a little too complex for mobile. I moved `Talk` to its own tab and pulled it out of the `save` process. I also moved `image too blurry` to the verification modal. 
2. Added an undo button. 
3. Added tutorial and field guide to pages, rather than modals. 
4. Panning and zooming the image is done with touch, rather than buttons. 

## Getting started

1. Follow React Native's instructions for getting started with Expo and the emulators: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
2. Run `expo start`
