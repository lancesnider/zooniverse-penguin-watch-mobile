# Penguin Watch Mobile

I'm playing around with what a mobile version of Zooniverse's [Penguin Watch](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch/) might look like.

## Getting started

1. Follow React Native's instructions for getting started with Expo and the emulators: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
2. Run `yarn run start`
